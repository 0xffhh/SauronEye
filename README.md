# SauronEye
SauronEye is a search tool built to aid red teams in finding files containing specific keywords. 

**Features**:
- Search multiple (network) drives
- Search contents of files
- Search contents of Microsoft Office files (`.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`)
- Search multiple drives multi-threaded for increased performance
- Compatible with Cobalt Strike's `execute-assembly`

It's also quite fast, can do 50k files, totaling 1,3 TB on a network drive in under a minute (with realistic file filters). Searches a `C:\` (on a cheap SATA SSD) in about 15 seconds.


### Usage

`SauronEye.exe -Dirs C:\, \\SOMENETWORKDRIVE\C$ -FileTypes .txt,.bat,.docx, .conf -Contents -Keywords password,pass -SystemDirs` 

```
C:\>SauronEye.exe -Dirs C:\, -FileTypes .docx -Contents -Keywords password

### Notes
SauronEye does not search `%WINDIR%` and `%APPDATA%`. 
Use the `-SystemDirs` flag to search the contents of `Program Files*`.
SauronEye relies on multi-threading libraries only available from .NET 4.0, and so requires >= .NET 4.0 to run.
